#### Privacy Policy

The "LaMetric Robinhood app" (the App) is downloadable software that runs on a userâ€™s LaMetric smart devices and uses Robinhood's unofficial Application Program Interface (API) Services. You can find out more about LaMetric smart devices at https://lametric.com.

The App is developed by Torrey Leonard and is available for free on the LaMetric app store. All of the software used by the app is open source and available in this GitHub repository. While running on a user's device, the App will request the user's Robinhood login credentials. These credentials are never stored and do not leave the scope of this project.
